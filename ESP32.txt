 -How to use ESP32 with a webpage-
    1) Program the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE
    2) Insure that it can interact using HTTP requests 
        Example code: 1. #include <HTTPClient.h>
    3) Create an HTTP request from ESP32 to the webpage (in this case the speech recognition page)
        Example code: 1. http.begin(client, servername)
                      2. response_code = httpGETRequest(servername)
    4) The page returns a response
    5) The response is parsed for the desired information
        Example code: 1. JSON.parse(response_code)
